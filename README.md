# Moodle Database: Educational Data Log Analysis
> In 2019, 10 Academy used the Moodle LMS to manage about 1000 students in their 6 months data science training. Learners, course instructors, and all admins interacted with the Moodle system for almost all the training activities. All events from these activities are logged in the moodle postgres database. Assuming a role-model of a freelancer hired by 10 Academy, you are to explore the 10 Academy Moodle logs stored in the database together with many other relevant tables. By the end of your analysis, you are expected to build a Tableau dashboard that illustrates the progress of students across time.
